# ðŸš€ Ultrasonic Distance Detection System ðŸš€

This project is a system developed using the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Module. Running on an STM32 microcontroller, it measures the distance to an object and triggers a buzzer for an audible warning when the distance falls below a certain threshold. This system can be used in various applications such as automatic door control, robotic sensor systems, and parking assistance systems.

## ðŸŒŸ Getting Started

Step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the project in your local environment!

### ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:
- STM32 microcontroller
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Module
- PinoLab-CodeBoard.Micro or a similar development board
- Buzzer and connection wires
- STM32CubeIDE or a similar development environment

### ðŸ›  Installation

Steps to set up the project:
1. Create a new project in STM32CubeIDE and configure the necessary settings.
2. Connect the HC-SR04 module and the buzzer to your development board.
3. Upload the provided code to your microcontroller.

## ðŸŽ® Usage

When the system is running:
- The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to an object in front of it.
- If the measured distance is 10 cm or less, the buzzer activates and emits a warning sound.
